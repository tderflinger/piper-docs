1. [Download a voice](/about/voices/download) and extract the `.onnx` and `.onnx.json` files
2. Run the `piper` binary with text on standard input, `--model /path/to/your-voice.onnx`, and `--output_file output.wav`

For example:

``` sh
echo 'Welcome to the world of speech synthesis!' | \
  ./piper --model en_US-lessac-medium.onnx --output_file welcome.wav
```

For multi-speaker models, use `--speaker <number>` to change speakers (default: 0).

See `piper --help` for more options.

### Streaming Audio

Piper can stream raw audio to stdout as its produced:

``` sh
echo 'This sentence is spoken first. This sentence is synthesized while the first sentence is spoken.' | \
  ./piper --model en_US-lessac-medium.onnx --output-raw | \
  aplay -r 22050 -f S16_LE -t raw -
```

This is **raw** audio and not a WAV file, so make sure your audio player is set to play 16-bit mono PCM samples at the correct sample rate for the voice.

### JSON Input

The `piper` executable can accept JSON input when using the `--json-input` flag. Each line of input must be a JSON object with `text` field. For example:

``` json
{ "text": "First sentence to speak." }
{ "text": "Second sentence to speak." }
```

Optional fields include:

* `speaker` - string
    * Name of the speaker to use from `speaker_id_map` in config (multi-speaker voices only)
* `speaker_id` - number
    * Id of speaker to use from 0 to number of speakers - 1 (multi-speaker voices only, overrides "speaker")
* `output_file` - string
    * Path to output WAV file
    
The following example writes two sentences with different speakers to different files:

``` json
{ "text": "First speaker.", "speaker_id": 0, "output_file": "/tmp/speaker_0.wav" }
{ "text": "Second speaker.", "speaker_id": 1, "output_file": "/tmp/speaker_1.wav" }
```

If you'd like to use a GPU, install the `onnxruntime-gpu` package:


``` sh
.venv/bin/pip3 install onnxruntime-gpu
```

and then run `piper` with the `--cuda` argument. You will need to have a functioning CUDA environment, such as what's available in [NVIDIA's PyTorch containers](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch).
